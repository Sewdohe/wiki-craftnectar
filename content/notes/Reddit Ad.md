# CraftNectar [Modded] [SMP] {1.19.2} {Custom Modpack} {Kitchen Sink}

**CraftNectar** - We like modded minecraft

  
Are you tired of vanilla Minecraft? Do you want to experience new dimensions, creatures, and items? Look no further than our modded server! Our server provides a unique and exciting experience for all players. With over 200 mods installed, you will be able to explore new worlds, craft powerful weapons, drive crazy vehicles, build amazing machines, fight challenging bosses, and so so much more!
  
Our team of moderators ensures that the gameplay is fair, safe, and balanced. We also have a friendly and active community, ready to assist you with any questions, issues, or even if you're having a hard time with doing something.

Our modpack has a little (or alot) of something for every player. 
- Like building? You'll find a myraid of different building blocks, including new wood, furniture, glass, roofs, doors, trapdoors, tables, storage, and TONS more stuff.
- An adventurer? We have tons of custom weapons, including the iconic dark souls weapons, extra bows / arrows, and all kinds of new and intersting armors.
- Like fighting / PVP? We have a dedicated arena accessible via waystone to set up PVP matches encased in glass so spectators can cheer for who they want to win.
- Like Crafting? We have so many things to craft I can't list them all here. With multiple cooking mods, tech mods, decoration mods, new biomes and materials, the things you can craft are nearly endless
- Merchant at heart? We got you covered as well. We have numismatic overhaul to mimic the currency used in Terraria (copper, silver, and gold coins) and with it you can trade with other players or even set up a shop and sell items while offline! Come become the richest on the server. 
- Stay safe or live on the edge - your choice. We have server land claims claimable via the minimap on right click. Customize your claim to allow usage or certain items - or don't! If you like base raiding and all that jazz just leave your home unclaimed - that means it's fair game! We also have a PVP toggle so you can take part in that if you so choose too. Or not. Regular players get 35 chunks to claim by default. Patrons get 60 or 100 extra claims depending on support level.
- and MORE!!! On top of all listed above we also usually have ~1 modpack update a week where we add community suggestions and new origins to play as!

100% FREE TO PLAY, ALWAYS!
CraftNectar is supported by it's admin (me) as well as it's playerbase. We have a Patreon for the server and the players who really love the server help support it for everyone else. Patrons only receive a name decoration and extra land claims, no P2W here.
