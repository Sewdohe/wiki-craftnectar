On CraftNectar, we have a money system similar to that of Terraria if you are familar with the game.

If not, it's basically like this:
- Gold Coin = 100 silver coin
- Silver Coin = 100 copper coin
- Copper Coins = basically a penny

Currency on the server serves the following purposes:
- Selling items via the shop block
- [[notes/land-claim]] buying claims from the claims villager located at spawn
