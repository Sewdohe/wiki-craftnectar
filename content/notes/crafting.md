We have **ALOT** of blocks. It can be overwhelming.

To remedy this, we have a mod called JEI. It can be accessed using the crafting menu (`E` by default)

When the crafting menu is open you'll see a myraid of blocks on the right side of your screen, along with a searchbar.

You can type anything you need to search for in the search bar and it will return results from all the installed mods we have.

You can also search by using the `@` symbol to search only within a certian mod, for example searching `@create` will only show you create blocks in your search results.

This is your bread and butter on the server.
