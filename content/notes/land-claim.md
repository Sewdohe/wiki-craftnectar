Players are able to claim land via the minimap that is bound to the `m` key by default.

To claim a plot of land (a chunk 16x16) open your minimap and right click on any non-claimed chunk within claim distance (up too 5 chunks away) and you will see an option to claim that chunk of land.

Once your land is claimed, you may press the `'` key to open the land-claim player config. Here you may customize what is accessible to members of your party as well as players who are NOT part of your party.

This allows a great level of customization for players to only allow interaction with certian kinds of blocks on certian claims of land.

**If the default allocation of 35 chunks isn't enough for your builds, please see** [[notes/earning-claims]]
