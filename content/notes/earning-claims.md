By default, each player on CraftNectar gets 35 chunks to claim as thier own by default.

However, we two ways to recieve more claims for players. One is paid, and one you can grind.

1. **Buy Them** - Earn claims by visiting the claims villager in spawn. He will sell you claims for 1g coin each, with a maximum of 200 total claims for a standard CraftNectar player. We have a [[notes/currency]] mod that mimics the monetairy system in Terraria. Please visit the Wiki page on the currency for more info.
2. **Server Support** - CraftNectar is supported by it's player-base and it's admin Sewdohe (me). In order to increase support for the server, we have created two Patreon levels that players can purchase. Level I and level II.
  2a. Level I - You will recieve a custom name decoration of your choice as well as 60 land claims by default and 3 forceloaded chunks.
  2b. Level II - You will recieve a custom name decoration of your choice as well as 100 land claims by default and 5 forceloaded chunks.
